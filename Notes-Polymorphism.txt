---------------------
poly -> One(single)
morph -> Many forms
--------------------------------
If same object have multiple forms, then that is called polymorphic object and this behavior is called polymorphism.

Choclate c = new DairyMilk();
Choclate c = new Kitkat();
Choclate c = new SweetChoclate();
-----------------------------------------

Car c = new Baleno();
Car c = new Polo();
car c = new TataNaxon();
