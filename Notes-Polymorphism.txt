Polymorphism
---------------------
poly -> One(single)
morph -> Many forms
--------------------------------
If same object have multiple forms, then that is called polymorphic object and this behavior is called polymorphism.

Choclate c = new DairyMilk();
Choclate c = new Kitkat();
Choclate c = new SweetChoclate();
-----------------------------------------

Car c = new Baleno();
Car c = new Polo();
car c = new TataNaxon();

----------------------------------


Abstract class
---------------------
Abstract class is the collection of abstract and concrete methods.

 - Abstract methods - are those which don't have any implementation.
 - Concrete methods - are those which have its implementation.

- If a method don't have its implementation then the method must be declared as an abstrat.
- If a class have any one abstract method then it must be declared as an abstract class.
- The object of abstract is not possible only reference of abstract class is possible.
- If a class extends an abstract class then child class either - must override all the abstract methods OR must declare itself as an abstract class. Otherwise it would be a compile time error.

Important pointer while working with abstract class and methods
---------------------------------------------------------------
- A private method can't be abstract.
- A final method can't be abstract.
- A constractor can't be abstract.

Exercise
----------------
Employee (id, name, age, salary)
    - Monthly Paid
        - basic salary (10000)
        - hra (6%)
        - da (8%)
        - ta (12%)
        - pf (8%)
        - Total Salary -> basic + hra+ da+ ta - pf
    - Hourly Paid
        - hours worked
        - rate / hour
        - total salary -> hours_worked * rate_per_hour
