1. Java is a programming language which is developed by `James Gosling` and Team in `Sun Microsystems`.
2. Java Team
    - James Gosling
    - Ed Frank
    - Mike Sheriden
    - Chris Worth
    - Patrick Naughton
3. Java is used to develop a rich set of application including desktop application, web application, mobile application and Network based application.

4. Desktop Application - are those which can be run on a single pc or standalone pc.
    - Microsoft word
    - Paint Brush
    - Google Chrome
    - Photoshop

5. Web Application - are those which are running over the server and can be accessed  by anyone through the internet.
    - Google Docs
    - Photopea
6. Mobile Application - are those application which is specially created for the mobiles.
    - Facebook app
    - Youtube app
7. Java is created under a green project for consumer related goods software in mind.
8. Intially java was named as `OAK` and later renamed with `JAVA`.
9. Before 1990's the applications are developed in C/ C++. and these applications are platform dependent.

10. How C / C++ application works?

    Hello.c             ---->   Compiler     ---> Hello.obj / Hello.o  ---> Linker -> Hello.exe
    (Source Code)                                   (Object Code)

Windows
-----------------
    printf("Hello World");  

        |

    show("Hello World");


Linux
---------------
    printf("Hello World");
            |
    display("Hello World");

11. C / C++ -> `Write Once & Compile Anywhere` (But Generally it is not happening as we have to write it again as per the linux or other os library availability)

12. How Java program works?

Hello.java (Windows)
------------------
System.out.println("Hello World"); (Source Code)    
    -> Compile (javac Hello.java) 
    -> Hello.class (Bytecode) 
    -> JVM (Java virtual Machine - Windows) 
    -> show("Hello World") -> Windows Instruction set to print something 
    -> Hello World (output)

Hello.java (Linux)
----------------------
System.out.println("Hello World"); (Source Code)    
    -> Compile (javac Hello.java) 
    -> Hello.class (Bytecode) 
    -> JVM (Java virtual Machine - Linux) 
    -> display("Hello World") -> Linux Instruction set to print something 
    -> Hello World (output)


13. Bytecode is platform independent.
14. Bytecode is only understood by JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
15. JVM is a hypothetical machine which understand bytecode and responsible to execute it on any platform.
16. Java is platform independent as it uses JVM and java code is executed by JVM but JVM itself is a platform dependent.
17. In 2009 Sun Microsystems is adopted by Oracle.

Environment Setup
--------------------------
1. jdk (java develpment Kit) - As as developer
    - Java Libraries
    - Java Compiler, Interpretor and other utility program
    - Java docs (Removed from version - 8)

2. As as consumer
    - JVM (OS in-build)

3. Set the java utility path (c:\program files\java\jdkX.x\bin) into the environment variable to access the java utility globally in your system.

Other program / Software tools
-----------------
4. Editor -> A software used to write or edit your programs.
    - Notepad
    - Notepad++
    - textpad
    - Visual Studio Code (Recommanded)

5. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) -> Editor + Compiler + Interpretor + Other utility tools (Warning -> Don't use them)
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Ecllipse
    - Netbeans
    - Intellij Idea

Java Flavors
---------------------
    1. Java Standard Edition (Java SE) -> Core Java
    2. Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) -> Web Application + Enterprise Application
    3. Java Mobile Edition (Java ME) -> Deprecated
        - These days for Mobile development Android, IOS (Native application envrionment are used).

Java Versions
-------------------
    1. Java 1.0 (1991)
      -Java 1.1 (1992)
    2. Java (jdk 1.2) (1993) -> Virtual Machine + (JIT -> Just in time) -> J2SE
    3. Java (jdk 1.3) -> J2SE
    4. Java (jdk 1.4) -> J2SE
    5. Java (jdk 1.5) -> J2SE
    6. Java (jdk 1.6) -> J2SE
    7. Java 7 -> Java SE
    8. Java 8
    9. Java 9
    ---------
    Java 21

OOPS
---------------
OOPS is a programming approach in which program is created with class and objects.

Object
------------
Any real world entity is called an object.
For ex: Pen, Car, mouse, keyboard, laptop, Account, Person, Student

Every object has some properties associated with it.

If `Person` is an object then properties are `name`, `age`, `height`, `gender`, `weight`, `address`

If `Student` is an object then properties are `student_id`, `class`, `degree`, `college`, `university`

If `Car` is an object then properties are `model`, `price`, `color`, `engine_capacity`, `fuel_type`, `brand`, `max_speed`, `mileage`

Along with the properties every object has some behavior / Operations also.

For example: 
If `Car` is an object then the operations are `start`, `stop`, `accelrate`, `turn`, `change-gear`, `break`

class 
--------------
class is a group of objects which have similar type of properties. Object is the snapshot / instance of a class.

--------------------------------------------------------
Create in Java Program - Hello World
-----------------------------------------------------
1. create a class name HelloWorld
2. Save it into a filename HelloWorld.java
3. Edit your program.
4. Compile the program
    - javac <program-name>
    - javac HelloWorld.java
5. After successfull compilation .class file generated
    - HelloWorld.class (Byte code)
6. To run the program, call the java iterpretor (JVM) by using `java` command
    - java <.class name without .class extension>
    - java HelloWorld
7. Behind the Schene
    HelloWorld.java (Source code) -> Compiler -> HelloWorld.class (Bytecode) -> JVM (java HelloWorld) -> Interpretor -> Display Result

Important pointers
------------------------
1. Whenever you compile a java program, java compiler generate .class file for each class in your java program seperately.
2. While running your program you have to supply the .class name (withour extension).
3. Only those classes directly executed from the command line which have main method.
4. The class which have main method is known as `Application class` or `Main class`
5. If a class is `public`, then public class must be saved in a file with the same name of class name.
6. A file can have only single public class.

-----------------------------------------
Command line Usage
------------------------------------------
1. Open the command line
    - Start menu -> search cmd -> press enter
2. To navigate withing directories
    - CD(Change directory)
        - cd <directory name or path>
    - cd .. (Move into the parent directory)
    - cd . (Move into the current directory)
    - cd \ (Move into the root directory)
    - d: (change the drive with d:)

Today's Exercise Question
---------------------------------
1. Write a program to find the sum of two numbers
2. Write a program to find the average of two numbers
