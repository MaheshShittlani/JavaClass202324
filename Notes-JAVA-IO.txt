Input / Output in java (java.io.*)
--------------------------------------
	In java input/ output is performed through streams

What is stream
------------------
	Source or Destination from where data is flowing.
		Input Stream: Reading data from
		Output Stream: Writing data to
Types of Streams
-------------------
	1. Byte Stream
		Read and Write data 1 byte at a time. It is used to deal with
		binary data as it is saved in memory.
		No conversion is happening while reading and writing data from
		stream to memory.
	2. Character Stream
		It is used to read / Write data in character format, 1 character at a time but in background data is stored in binary so character stream is connected with binary stream to read / write binary data and convert them into character.
		So here the conversion from binary to character and character to binary is happening in background.
    
        Mostly used in read world.

Byte Stream class hierarchy
----------------------------------
- InputStream(A)
    -FileInputStream(C)
	-BufferedInputStream(C)
	-FilterInputStream(A)
		-DataInputStream(C)
		-SequenceInputStream(C)
		-ByteArrayInputStream(C)
		-LineNumberInputStream(C)
		-ObjectInputStrweam(C)
-OutputStream(A)
    -FileOutputStream(C)
	-BufferedOutputStream(C)
	-FilterOutputStream(A)
		-DataOutputStream(C)
		-ByteArrayOutputStream(C)
		-ObjectOutputStream(C)
	-PrintStream (Universal Stream)
		- print()
		- println()

Character Stream class hierarchy
------------------------------------
Reader(A)
	- FileReader
	- FilterReader
		- CharArrayReader
		- StringReader
		- BufferedReader
Writer(A)
	- FileWriter
	- FilterWriter
		- CharArrayWriter
		- StringWriter
		- BufferedWriter
	- PrintWriter (Universal Stream)
		- print()
		- println()

----------------------------------------
java.io.InputStream(A) Methods
	- int read(): Read one byte and return int version, return -1 for EOF. throws IOException
	- int read(byte[] b): Read one byte and put it into array `b` and 
						program reads data from array, Return how many 
						bytes are successfully read.
	- int read(byte[], int off, int len)
	- void close() throws IOException
	- long skip(long n)
    - int available()
    - void mark()
    - void reset()
    - boolean markSupported()

java.io.OutputStream(A) Methods
	- int write()
	- int write(byte[])
	- int write(byte[], int off, int len)
	- void close()
	- void flush()
---------------------------------

FileInputStream
    - Used to read the data from a file.

FileInputStream
----------------------
	-FileInputStream(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException
	-FileInputStream(File file) throws FileNotFoundException
	
FileOutputStream : Used to write the data into a file.
-----------------------
	- FileOutputStream(String filename)
	- FileOutputStream(File file)
	- FileOutputStream(String filename, boolean append)
	- FileOutputStream(File file, boolean append)
	
Exercise
----------
	FileInputStream(a.txt) -> fis ------------- fos -> FileOutputStream(b.txt)

a.txt -> (fis)---> bis -----> Program -> bos -> fos -> b.txt


Exercise
-------------------
Read a file and count the following things...
	1. Total Characters
	2. Total digits
	3. Total Alphabets
	4. Total Spaces

Copy a file such that Reverse the file content.

DataInputStream/ DataOutputStream: is used to read/write the in the primitive format. 

DataOutputStream creates a file in binary format which can be retrived only with DataInputStream.

While reading a file it throws `EOFException` when cursor reach to the End of the File.
 
DataInput(I) provide the specification to read the data in primitive format. It defined all the methods to read primitive data.
	-readXXX()

DataInputStream implements DataInput
	- readByte()
	- readShort()
	- readInt()
	- readLong()
	- readFloat()
	- readDouble()
	- readBoolean()
	- readLine()

DataOutput: provides the specification to write the data in primitive format.
	- writeXXX()
DataOutputStream implements DataOutput
	- writeByte()
	- writeShort()
	- writeInt()
	- writeLong()
	- writeFloat()
	- writeDouble()
	- writeBoolean()

Generate 100 random integer numbers and write into a file named numbers.dat.

Read numbers.dat and seperate the even and odd number. write the even numbers in even.dat and odd numbers in odd.dat


SequenceInputStream: Used to read the data sequenctially from multiple data sources.

Serialization / Deserialization
--------------------------------

Serialization: is a process in which an object is stored in a file.

Deserialization: is a reverse process of Serialization in which object is restored from a file.


A class must implements Serializable interface if we want to store the object of that class.
Serializable is a marker interface and have no method which need to implmented by child class.

class Person implements Serializable {

}

To write an object into a file we use ObjectOutpuStream and the method writeObject(object) is used to write the object.

Similarly to read the object we use readObject() method of ObjectInputStream

PrintStream
-----------------
	PrintStream(OutputStream out)
	PrintStream(OutputStream out, boolean autoFlush)

PrintWriter
----------------
	PrintWriter(Writer out)
	PrintWriter(Writer out, boolean autoFlush)

InputSteamReader
---------------------
It is the bridge between byte stream and character stream. and convert the byte stream into character stream.

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

int a = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

---------------------------------------
java.io.File
-----------------------------
It represent a path of a file or Directory(folder) on a system in the platform independent manner.

This class allows you to fetch the information about a path or file using file class object. Means this class gives you the facility to fetch the metadata about a file or directory path.

	File(String path)
	File(String directory, String filename)
	File(File directory, String filename)

Example:
	File f = new File("d:/textfiles");
	File f1 = new File("d:/textfiles", "a.txt");
	File f2 = new File(f, "a.txt");

Methods
-------------
	String getName()
	String getParent()
	String getPath()
	String getAbsolutePath()
	String getCanonicalPath()

	File getAbsoluteFile();
	File getCanonicalFile();


	f.isDirectory()
	f.isFile()
	f.exists()
	f.createNewFile() throws IOException
	f.isHidden()
	f.canRead()
	f.canWrite()
	f.lastModified():long timestamp
	f.setReadable(boolean)
	f.setWriteable(boolean)
	f.renameTo(File): rename & move

	String[] f.list()
	Files[] f.listFiles()
	String[] f.list(java.io.FilenameFilter)
	File[] f.listFiles(java.io.FilenameFilter);
