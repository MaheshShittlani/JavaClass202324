OOPS (Object Oriented Programming Structure): 
    It is a programming approach / Paradigm in which program is created with objects (class).

What is the Object:
-----------------------
Object is a real world entity which have some properties / behaviors (actions) associated with it.

For example: if car is an object the properties are...
    model, make, price, color, brand, maxspeed, currentSpeed, number_of_gears and many more...

    and behaviors associated with the car are...
    start(), stop(), accelarate(), break(), turn(), changeGear()


What is the class?
------------------------
1. Class is the group of objects which have similar properties.

2. Class is a template / blue print which have all the instructions that how object will behave and what properties object have.

3. Object is the instance(screenshot) of the class whereas class is the description of the object.

4. class is a logical entity which physical representation is realized by an object.

5. Once a class is crated it becomes a data type which variables are called an object.


Creating a class 
-----------------------
    class <class Name> {
        member

        returntype method1() {

        }
        returntype method2() {

        }
    }


Example:
    class Circle {

    }
Creating an object
------------------------
    2 step process
    -------------------->
        1. Creating reference variable
        -------------------------------
        Circle c1;
        Circle c1, c2, c3;

        2. Creating an object
        ----------------------
            c1 = new Circle();
            c2 = new Circle();

        3. Both in single step
        ------------------------
            Circle c1 = new Circle();


Primitive Varaible V/S Reference varaible
----------------------------------------------
    A variable is a cup of tea.
1. A primitive variable is a cup of tea which contains the binary value of a variable. Means a primitive variable itself contains data.

2. A reference variable doesn't contains object data, it have a way to send the instruction to the object.

    For example - If reference variable is a cup of tea then it contains remote control to send the instruction to the object but it doesn't contains the object data.
